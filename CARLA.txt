The CARLA Driving Simulator is a freely available driving simulator for use in Autonomous Vehicle Research. It can be found at http://carla.org/, with version 0.8.4 being the one the CMU MHCI team used for the Capstone project.

For our integration, we simply downloaded the version 0.8.4 compiled Windows file at https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/releases. There is a version 0.9.0 but it changed much of the Python API, so we did not upgrade to it as it may break our existing implementation.

Thus we simply unzipped the Windows zip, added our Python HTTP server under /PythonClient and then would first run CarlaUE4.exe in Carla Server mode (-carla-server) and without the HUD (-no-hud) before running the Python HTTP server with python use_case_controller.py.
